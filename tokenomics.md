# Intial Token Distribution

A fair initial mint is needed to ensure the vision of a truly decentralized and player owned gambling platform is reached.  Below is a description of how the initial supply of Sigma Squared tokens will be distributed.  The vast majority is set aside for players.  This is to get players involved in the community, ensure they are entitled to game profits, and to make sure they have a voice in the future of the ecosystem.

### **Total Circulating: 10,000,000 SIGMA2**

**Player Rewards: 8,500,000 SIGMA2 (85%)**

- To ensure the vast majority of tokens are in the hands of players.

**DAO Treasury: 500,000 SIGMA2 (5%)**

- To be used for future development, marketing, and community growth.

**Early developers, test users, and investors: 1,000,000 SIGMA2  (10%)**

- This is a reward for early developers, users, and investors.  This ensures the people behind the vision hold a significant controlling stake in the DAO initially, to prevent any sort of hostile takeover or other action.

In addition to this circulating supply, 2,500,000 SIGMA2 will be added to the game contracts denominated in SIGMA2, to payout future bet winners.

### **Total: 12,500,000 SIGMA2**

# DAO Initiatives

The DAO’s treasury is intended to be used to further the development and adoption of Sigma Squared.  Below are a few suggestions of how the DAO’s treasury might be used in the future.  In the end, what happens will always be up to Sigma Squared token holders, as the treasury can only be spent by submitting and voting on proposals.

### Hackathons or contest for front-end game development

- Improving the gambling experience for players will further the adoption of Sigma Squared.  To encourage this, the DAO could hold a hackathon or contest where developers submit the best front-end gambling interface/game.  The winner(s) would receive payment from the DAO’s treasury, specified beforehand.

### Marketing

- The DAO could pay firms (or individuals) to market Sigma Squared, helping to bring even more players on board.  Care must be taken to ensure due diligence is done before any payment is made, and that any compensation agreement is fair and in line with the current market conditions.

### Future player rewards or buybacks

- Because some game contracts have a positive house edge, in the future the DAO’s treasury will increase beyond the SIGMA2 tokens initially deposited.  When this happens the DAO could vote to set up a new player rewards system (after the initial one has been decommissioned).  Or it could facilitate SIGMA2 buybacks, which indirectly reward users and holders of Sigma Squared.

After the Sigma Squared community is mature, these ideas can be discussed and fully fleshed out.  Community feedback is important, and Sigma Squared holders should help determine the future of the ecosystem.

# Long-term Token Supply

When using SIGMA2 tokens, players can bet with 0% house edge.  Because of this, the SIGMA2 game contract balances will drift over time and not trend in one direction or the other.  The balance will be a random walk (or martingale).  The expected future balance will always be whatever the current balance is, however there can be drift in one direction of the other.

When the SIGMA2 game contract balances are very low, the DAO will mint more SIGMA2 tokens to replenish it.  When the SIGMA2 game contract balances are extremely high, the DAO will withdraw and burn tokens.  This means that the circulating supply of SIGMA2 will also be a random walk.  Similarly, the expected future circulating supply will be whatever the current circulating supply is, however there can be random drift in one direction or the other.
