# How To Get Assets Into Polygon

You can bridge assets from Ethereum to Polygon using a bridge such as the [official Polygon one.]((https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge))

If you donâ€™t have any existing crypo assets, you can use a [fiat on-ramp](https://wallet.polygon.technology/on-ramp) to deposit crypo directly into your Polygon wallet.

You can also use an exchange to buy assets and transfer them directly to your Polygon wallet.  [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/us/) allows you to buy USDC and MATIC and transfer directly to the Polygon network.  Something like this is likely the most efficient way to get assets (in terms of gas).
